The Elite Patch
==========
The Elite Patch was specifically to bypass the restriction that uk isp's put on websites. With V3, the system has changed completely. The main function of The Elite Patch (TEP) is still functioning, however TEP has more than just the ability to bypass those blocks. In essance, TEP has evolved into more than just a way to get onto restricted sites, into a collection of tools to perform any function required.
